<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  A beginner's guide to trading tools and tactics, money management, discipline and trading psychology.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
  This "How to day trade for a living" article is from the same named book by <b>Andrew Aziz</b>.
</p>
<p>
  To get the full experience and gain the most knowledge it is recommended that you purchase and read the book yourself.
</p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<div class="bold">
  <ol>
    <li>
      Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly.
    </li>
    <li>
      Day trading is not easy.  It is serious business, and you should treat is as such.
    </li>
    <li>
      Day traders do not hold positions overnight.  If necessary, you must sell with a loss to make sure you do not hold onto any stock overnight.
    </li>
    <li>
      Always ask, "Is this stock moving because of the overall market is moving, or is this moving because it has a unique fundamental catalyst?"
    </li>
    <li>
      Success in day trading comes from risk management - finding low-risk entries with a high potential reward. The minimum win:lose ratio should be 2:1.
    </li>
    <li>
      Your broker will buy and sell stocks for you at the Exchange.  Your only job as a day trader is to manage risk.  You cannot be a successful day trader
      without excellent risk management skills, even if you are the master of many effective strategies.
    </li>
    <li>
      Retail traders trade only Stocks in Play, high relative volume stocks that have fundamental catalysts and are being traded regardless of the overall market.
    </li>
    <li>
      Experienced traders are like guerrilla traders.  They jump out at just the right time, take their profit, and get out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hallow candlesticks, where the close is greater than the open, indicate buying pressure.  Filled candlesticks, where the close is less than the open,
      indicate selling pressure.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Business Plan:</b> This is a business (refer Rule #2) and should be treated as such.  This includes having a strategy, equipment, and discipline.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Education:</b> Like every professional a proper education and practice is required to be successful.  Expect to invest about $1,500 the first year.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Startup Capital:</b> Just like any other business there must be the cash for equipment, education, and the buying of stock.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Tools and Services:</b> A high-speed internet connection, broker, trading platform, and support from a community.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>The Basics of Day Trading</h2>

<h3>Day Trading vs Swing Trading</h3>
<p>
  <b>Day trading</b> is the trading of stocks within the same day while <b>swing trading</b> is the trading of stocks over multiple days.  Day traders
  always close their position before the market closes (refer Rule #3).
</p>

<h3>Long vs Short</h3>
<p>
  When a trader buys stock in the hope that its value will increase is called <b>buying long</b>.  Going long entails the actual purchase of the stock
  and selling it at a higher price, so if someone says they are long on a stock then they intend the price or value to increase.  The profit comes from
  the difference in price from the original purchase value to the next sell value.
</p>
<p>
  The borrowing of stock to with the hope that the price or value will decrease is called <b>selling short</b>.  They this works is a trader borrows stock from
  a broker and sells it right away and then purchases back the stock at a lower price.  The broker just wants the shares back and does not want your money, so
  the profit for the trader is the difference between the original selling price and price that stock is purchases back at.
</p>

<h3>Retail vs Institution</h3>
<p>
  Individuals like us are called <b>retail traders</b> while investment banks, firms, mutual funds, hedge funds, and other organizations are called
  <b>institutional traders</b>.  Most algorithmic or automated trading is done by institutional traders.
</p>

<h3>High Frequency Trading (HFT)</h3>
<p>
  As mentioned above, this is the automated trading done by institutional traders using computer algorithms at high speeds.  It is important to be mindful and
  respectful of these stocks current in play by HFT in order to avoid competition and losses.
</p>

<h3>Trade the best, leave the rest</h3>
<p>
  It is important to play the best stocks that have a fundamental reason to move and are not moving with the market (refer Rule #4).  Stocks in play usually
  have some positive or negative unexpected news like the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Earnings reports</li>
  <li>Earning warning or pre-announcements</li>
  <li>Earnings surprises</li>
  <li>FDA approvals or disapprovals</li>
  <li>Mergers or acquisitions</li>
  <li>Alliances, partnerships, or major product releases</li>
  <li>Major contract wins or losses</li>
  <li>Restructurings, layoffs, or management changes</li>
  <li>Stock splits, buybacks, or debt offerings</li>
</ul>

<h2>Business Management</h2>
<p>
  The following three skills are important to proper business management and its success:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Learning and mastering one or a few proven trading strategies.</li>
  <li>Practicing proper risk management.</li>
  <li>Controlling your emotions and having sound psychology.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  It is recommended to practice the five facets of training outlined by Nike: movement, mindfulness, recovery, nutrition, and sleep.  For trading, Andrew
  recommends a similar five facets: technical knowledge, risk management, nutrition, sound psychology, and sleep.
</p>
<p>
  To minimize risk it is important to ask yourself these questions:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Am I trading the right stock?</b><br />
    You should avoid stocks that are: heavily traded by computers, have small relative trading volume, penny stocks, and don't have a reason to move (no fundamental catalyst).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What share size should I take?</b><br />
    This should depend on your account size and daily target earnings.  What is your daily trading goal or annual target salary?
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>What is my stop loss?</b><br />
    An easy way of looking at this is you should never lose more than <b>2%</b> of your account in any trade, so if your account is $50,000 then you should not lose more than $1,000,
    e.g. \($50,000 * 0.02 = $1,000\).
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Three-step Risk Management</h3>
<blockquote>
  "It's all about minimizing risk."
</blockquote>
<ol>
  <li>
    Determine your maximum dollar risk for the trade, see #3 above, which should be %2.  Calculate this before your trading starts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Estimate your maximum risk per share, the stop loss, in dollars, from your entry.
  </li>
  <li>
    Now divide step #1 by step #2 to find the maximum number of shares you are allowed to trade.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  For example, if your account has $40,000, the %2 rule will limit your risk to $800 per trade (step #1 above).  You see a stock in play and decide to sell short at $50 and you want to
  cover at $48.82, with a stop loss at $50.40.  You will be risking $0.40 per share (step #2 above).  For step #3 above, you calculate your share size by dividing \($800.00 / $0.42 = 2000\).
  Of course you do not have enough money in your account to buy 2000 shares at $50 because \(2000 * $50 = $100,000\), so you buy less like 800 shares which is \(800 * $50 = $40,000\).  The
  point is to make sure that you never risk more than 2% of your account under any circumstance.
</p>
<h3>Trading Psychology</h3>
<blockquote>
  "Check your emotions at the door."
</blockquote>
<p>
  The most important part is to leave emotions and money out of the picture.  To be successful, you must stick to strategy and execution of the strategy like a robot.  Fine-tuning of strategies
  and their execution should take precedence and fit you personally.
</p>
<p>
  It is ok to take a loss for the day and not have it ruin your day.  It is not about you as a person but more about having the right strategy and executing it well.  This is why it is important
  to practice and find a strategy that fits your personality well, so play into your strengths and work on your weaknesses.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned, you should review your strategies over long periods of time to allow for tuning of it for the best outcome.  That is why it is important to keep a journal of all your trades, for
  reflection, and to connect with a community to help.
</p>
<p>
  Event experienced traders can expect to lose 30% of the time and you can be profitable with a risk of 2% and losing 40%, so remember its a numbers and strategy game.
</p>

<h2>Finding Stocks for Trades</h2>
<blockquote>
  "You are only as good as the stocks you trade."
</blockquote>
<p>
  Stocks in play must move and have enough volume in order to make a profit and minimize risk.  This doesn't mean any stock moving but one that is moving in a predictable pattern.
</p>
<h3>Stocks in Play</h3>
<p>
  Andrew outlines that the best stocks in play have the following characteristics:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A stock with fresh news.</li>
  <li>A stock that is up or down more than 2% before the market open.</li>
  <li>A stock that has unusual pre-market trading activity.</li>
  <li>A stock that develops important intraday levels which we can trade off from.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  It is recommended that stocks with less than an average daily volume below 500,000 should not be traded because it may be difficult to get out of a stock easily and will cause the trader to
  be stuck with the stock, therefore increasing the risk and account loss.
</p>
<h3>Float and Market Cap</h3>
<p>
  <b>Float</b> refers to the number of shares available for trading.  There are different categories of <b>market capitalization</b> or <b>market cap</b>.
</p>
<p>
  The following is a table that outlines the categories and the types of strategies that can be played per each:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Float
    </th>
    <th>
      Price Range<br />
      <i>(Per share)</i>
    </th>
    <th>
      Strategy
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Low float (&lt; 20 million)<br />
      <i>(Small Cap or Micro Cap)</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      &lt; $10
    </td>
    <td>
      Only Momentum (Long)
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Medium float (20-500 million)<br />
      <i>(Medium Cap)</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      $10-$100
    </td>
    <td>
      All, mostly VWAP and Support or Resistance
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Large float (&gt; 500 million)<br />
      <i>(Mega Cap)</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      Any<br />
      <i>(usually &ge; $20)</i>
    </td>
    <td>
      All, Mostly Moving Average and Reversal
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  Stocks in play can be found in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pre-market morning watchlist.</li>
  <li>Real time intraday scans.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pre-market Gappers</h3>
<p>
  A morning scanner with the following criteria that is the primary list for picking for stocks in play:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stocks that in the pre-market gapped up or down at least 3%.</li>
  <li>Stocks that have traded at least 50,000 shares in the pre-market.</li>
  <li>Stocks that have an average daily volume of over 500,000 shares.</li>
  <li>Stocks that have Average True Range (ATR) of at least $0.50 (how large of a range in price a stock has on average every day).</li>
  <li>There is a fundamental catalyst for the stock.</li>
  <li>
    As a rule, do not trade stocks with an enormous short interest higher than 30% (the short interest is the quantity of stock
    shares that investors or traders have sold short but not yet covered or closed out).
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Real Time Intraday Scans</h3>
<p>
  For some strategies you cannot find socks in the pre-market: The Momentum, Top Reversal, and Bottom Reversal.  These are when trading
  happens during trading hours.
</p>
<h4>Real Time Volume Radar</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Have gapped up or down at least $1.</li>
  <li>Have ATR of more than $0.50.</li>
  <li>Have average relative volume of at least 1.5 (the stock is trading at 1.5 times its normal volume).</li>
  <li>Have average daily volume of at least 500,000 shares.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  If there are several stocks that match this criteria in the same sector then they are probably not in play.  It is possible that they are
  being heavily traded by institutional traders.
</p>
<h4>Real Time Bull Flag Momentum Scanner</h4>
<p>
  For the Momentum Strategy, you need low float stocks that are moving and you cannot find these stocks without a good scanner.  These stocks
  have high relative volume, low float, and high activity.
</p>
<h4>Real Time Reversal Scanners</h4>
<p>
  Top and Bottom Reversal Strategies are strategies you cannot find stocks for in the pre-market.  These are stocks that are selling off or
  surging up so Reversal strategies can be used.
</p>
<h3>Planning the Trade Based on Scanners</h3>
<p>
  Select two or three stocks to play and monitor their charts.  When a strategy reveals itself, play it (refer Rule #8)!  HFT are designed to
  "shake out" retail traders, so must be smart.
</p>

<h2>Tools and Platforms</h2>
<h3>Which Broker</h3>
<p>
  You need an awesome direct-access broker to trade with.  Andrew currently uses <a href="https://interactivebrokers.com">Interactive Brokers</a>
  (IB) because they are inexpensive and established broker that offers discounted fees.  For offshore,
  <a href="https://cmelitegroup.com">Capital Markets Elite Group Limited</a> (CMEG) is recommended because there is no PDT enforcement and they offer
  6:1 margin vs IB's 3:1 margin.
</p>
<h4>Pattern Day Trade Rule</h4>
<p>
  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) enforce laws that limit the number
  of trades a trader can make if they are undercapitalized.  A <b>Pattern Day Trader (PDT)</b> is someone that buys and sells four or more times in
  five business days.  Under this rule, a pattern day trader must maintain a brokerage account balance of at least $25,000 any day they trade.
  This is to protect new traders.
</p>
<p>
  This rule can be bypassed by using an offshore trader such as Capital Markets Elite Group Limited (based in Trinidad and Tobago) or Alliance Trader
  (based in Jamaica).  These brokers offer a slightly higher commission fee structure.
</p>
<h4>Conventional vs Direct-Access</h4>
<p>
  Conventional Brokers aka Full-Service Brokers provide a greater number of services, slower trader execution times, and have higher fees that
  are better suited for swing trading.  Direct-Access Brokers provide faster trade execution at lower fees and are a must for day trading.
</p>
<h4>Proprietary Trading Firms</h4>
<p>
  Also known as <b>prop firms</b>, these firms allow you to trade with their money instead of your own capital.  Some of them also offer mentorship
  and access to tools.  In 2020, Andrew founded Peak Capital Trading based in Vancouver, Canada and allows a trader to retain 85% of their profits.
  Other popular prop firms are <a href="https://smbcap.com">SMB Capital</a> and <a href="https://sevenpointscapital.com">Seven Points Capital</a>.
</p>
<h3>Trading Platform</h3>
<p>
  Is a piece of software that interacts with direct-access brokers and provides features like charting, hotkeys, etc.  Andrew uses the
  <a href="https://dastrader.com">DAS Trader</a> platform with IB.  Refer to the following table for popular options:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Broker</th>
    <th>Trading Platform</th>
    <th>PDT Restriction</th>
    <th>Based In</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>IB</td>
    <td>TWS or DAS Trader</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Lightspeed</td>
    <td>Lightspeed Trader</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>TD Ameritrade</td>
    <td>thinkorswim (TOS)</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>

<h3>Real Time Market Data</h3>
<p>
  Day traders need real time market data unlike swing traders who can use free sources, day traders need to pay either their broker or trading platform
  (like DAS Trader) for the live feed.  For U.S. markets this will be the Nasdaq TotalView Level 2 data feed.
</p>
<h3>NASDAQ Level 2 and Bid-Ask</h3>
<p>
  Level 2 data provides the <b>leading indicator</b> for information before trades happen while moving averages and charts provide <b>lagging indicators</b>.
  The real time Level 2 data is a must for day trading in order to know who is trading and price action.
</p>
<p>
  A <b>bid</b> is the price a trader is willing to purchase stock for and the <b>ask</b> is the price a trader is willing to sell a stock for. The <b>size</b>
  is the number of lots of shares and a lot is usually 100 shares, so a size of 2 is 200 shares.  A <b>spread</b> is the difference between the bid and ask
  price.  Spreads are usually greater in lower volume stocks.
</p>
<h3>Chart Indicators</h3>
<p>
  The following indicators are what Andrew uses on his charts and are automatically calculated by DAS Trader:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Price action in the form of candlesticks.</li>
  <li>Volume of shares being traded.</li>
  <li>9 Exponential Moving Average (9 EMA)</li>
  <li>20 Exponential Moving Average (20 EMA)</li>
  <li>50 Simple Moving Average (20 SMA)</li>
  <li>200 Simple Moving Average (200 SMA)</li>
  <li>Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP)</li>
  <li>Previous day's closing price.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The following indicators are not provided by DAS Trader and must be done manually:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Daily levels of support or resistance.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  All moving averages are plotted in gray while VWAP is in blue.  <b>VWAP is the most important day trading indicator and needs to be easily and quickly
  distinguished from the other moving averages.</b>
</p>
<h3>Buy and Sell Orders</h3>
<p>
  The following are the three important types of orders you can use for day trading:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Market orders:</b> Buy or sell at any price, current market ask-bid price, but do it immediately.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Limit orders:</b> Buy or sell at my set limit price and don't go higher or lower. This is commonly used in swing trading.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Marketable limit orders:</b> Buy or sell at the current market (ask-bid) but do not go higher or lower.  This should be used for day trading.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Hotkeys</h3>
<p>
  These are keyboard shortcuts that allow for programming actions to be triggered quickly, e.g. exit a trade.  They allow for very fast actions as compared
  to moving and clicking with a mouse.  The following is an example mapping of hotkeys used with DAS Trader:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Function</th>
    <th>Hotkey</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1 min chart</td>
    <td>F1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5 min chart</td>
    <td>F2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Daily chart</td>
    <td>F4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Weekly chart</td>
    <td>F5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Monthly chart</td>
    <td>F6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Buying long</b></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buy 400 shares at limit (Ask + $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buy 200 shares at limit (Ask + $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + Q</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buy 100 shares at limit (Ask + $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + A</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sell 1/2 position at limit (Bid - $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Sell full position at limit (Bid - $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Selling short</b></td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short 400 shares at limit (Bid - $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short SSR 400 shares at limit (Ask)</td>
    <td>Alt + 5</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short 200 shares at limit (Bid - $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + R</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short SSR 200 shares at limit (Ask)</td>
    <td>Alt + T</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short 100 shares at limit (Bid - $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + F</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Short SSR 100 shares at limit (Ask)</td>
    <td>Alt + G</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buy to cover 1/2 position at limit (Ask + $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 6</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Buy to cover full position at limit (Ask + $0.05)</td>
    <td>Alt + 7</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>
  There are different hotkeys when a stock is in Short Selling Restriction (SSR) mode. An SSR is triggered when a stock is down 10% or more from the
  previous day's closing price, and is when regulators and exchanges restrict short selling of the stock when the price is dropping.  You can only short
  sell on the ask, you cannot short sell directly to the buyers (on the bid).
</p>
<p>
  Everyone makes mistakes using the hotkeys and that is why it is important to practice on a simulator.
</p>
<h3>Watchlist and Scanners</h3>
<p>
  Finding the right stock to trade is one of the hardest parts of trading and takes practice.
</p>
<h3>Community of Traders</h3>
<p>
  Trading alone can be emotionally taxing, so it can be easier to have the support of like minded individuals in a community setting like the Bear Bull
  Traders chatroom that Andrew uses.
</p>

<h2>Introduction to Candlesticks</h2>
<p>
  Candlesticks represent the price action and originated in Japan in the 17th century.  In order to chart a candlestick you must have the following data:
  opening price, highest price, lowest price, and closing price all for the desired time frame (daily, 1-minute, 5-minute, etc.).  The hollow (white) or filled
  (red) portion of the candlestick is called "the body".  The long thin lines above and below are called "shadows" and represent the high/low range, these are
  also referred to as "wicks" or "tails".  For the time period, if a stock closes higher than its opening price the body will be hallow (white), and if the
  stock closes at a lower price than its opening it will be filled (red).  When the body is hallow (white) the top of the body will be the close price and the
  bottom will be the open price, and when the body if filled (red) the top of it will be the open and the bottom will be the close.  Hallow bodies are
  bullish and filled bodies are bearish (refer Rule #9).
</p>
<h3>Price Action and Mass Psychology</h3>
<p>
  At every moment in the market there are basically three categories of traders: the buyers, the sellers, and the undecided.  Buyers are looking for deals and
  want to spend as little as possible, and sellers are wanting to sell their shares for as high as possible.  The difference between the two is referred to as
  the <b>bid-ask spread</b>.  The undecided traders are the key in pushing the price higher or lower, and they are feared by all other traders.  When buyers
  keep buying because they think the price will go up the common phrase used is, "Buyers are in control."  When the sellers keep selling because they think the
  price will continue to decrease the phrase, "Sellers are in control", is used.  It is fear of the unknown that causes buyers and sellers to buy for future
  profit or to sell to keep a higher price.
</p>
<h3>Bullish Candlestick</h3>
<p>
  These candlesticks are large hallow and show that the buyers are in control and tells that the price has potential to go higher.
</p>
<h3>Bearish Candlestick</h3>
<p>
  These candlesticks are large filled and show that the sellers are in control and tells that the price has potential to go lower.
</p>
<h3>Indecision Candlesticks</h3>
<h4>Spinning Tops</h4>
<p>
  These candlesticks have similarly-sized wicks that are usually larger than the body.  They represent that the pressure is equal for the buyers and sellers.
  It is common for the price to change immediately after these.
</p>
<h4>Doji: Simple, Shooting Star, Hammer</h4>
<p>
  These candlesticks commonly take on the form of a small or nil body.  The simple doji means nobody has one the battle yet (equal wicks).  The shooting
  star doji means that the buyers tried to push the price up but did not manage to hold it (the top wick is longer).  The hammer doji means the sellers
  tried to push the price down but did not manage to hold it (the bottom wick is longer).
</p>
<p>
  An example of reversal is when the market is bearish and there have been several filled candlesticks pushing the price down.  Then a hammer doji appears
  shows that the sell off of the stock can no longer be maintained.  This is then followed by several hallow candlesticks showing the price going up or
  recovering from the short.  It is important to remember that while this seems clear and easy to trade on all dojis it does not actually represent a
  market reversal and further indication should be referenced before trading.
</p>
<h3>Candlestick Patterns</h3>
<p>
  There are many patterns used in the while but most of them are considered wishful thinking and if someone is in the mood to buy or sell that will have an
  impact on the "found" pattern.  It is important to stick to simple and proven patterns.
</p>

<h2>Important Day Trading Strategies</h2>
<p>
  This section will focus on strategies based on three elements: price action, technical indicators, and candlestick and chart patterns.  As a day trader, you
  should not be concerned with the details of a company, only the technical analysis of the stock.
</p>
<h3>Trade Management and Position Sizing</h3>
<p>
  Most novice traders make the mistake and setting up their trades and letting them reach their stop or limit, while more experienced traders will manage
  their open positions. This is essentially trade management and allows experienced traders to more constantly turn a profit even if two of them are taking
  opposite positions, long vs short.

<p>
  Position sizing refers to how large of a position to take during a trade. <b>Load the boat</b> means taking a huge position on an obvious trade.  Some other
  terminology is <b>large</b> for a large position and <b>taste</b> for a small position.  It is important to remember risk management and the amount of risk
  to take on each trade (like 2% loss).

  Never average down!!! Take your losses and find another stock in play to trade.

<h3>ABCD</h3>
<img src="/assets/img//trading/abcd.png" />
<ul>
  <li>A - Aggressive buying has pushed the stock to constant new highs for the day.</li>
  <li>B - Traders who bought the stock earlier start slowly selling it for a profit and the price comes down.</li>
  <li>C - When a support has been reached and does not go lower and then starts to trend upwards.</li>
  <li>D - The price as surpassed the previous high at point A and will continue upwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The stop loss should be set at point C but trail it upwards to ensure the most profit is taken.  After the next surge up at point D the stock should be sold.
  This screenshot was taken at the time of this writing and actually shows two ABCD patterns taken place with the second pattern being directly after the
  annotated point D in the image.  The second ABCD patterns point A is also point D as labeled in the image.

<h3>Bull Flag Momentum</h3>
<img src="/assets/img//trading/bull-flag-momentum.png" />
<p>
  This pattern gets it name because it resembles a flag pole and waving flag.  The pole consists of several large candlesticks going up followed by a series of
  small candlesticks going sideways.  It is usually hard to catch the first Bull Flag.  After the first consolidation a long position is taken after the second
  pole makes a new high for the day, as shown above.  The position is then sold at the peak at the beginning of another consolidation that you should be part of.
  The volume can be much higher after the first consolidation which is a sign for a long entry.
